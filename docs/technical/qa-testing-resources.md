## Introduction to Software Testing <a name="introduction"></a>

### What is Software Testing?
Software testing is the process of evaluating a software application to identify any bugs, gaps, or missing requirements in comparison to the actual requirements. It involves the execution of a software program to find software bugs, verify the software's functionality, and ensure it meets the specified requirements.

### Key Concepts
- **Test Case**: A set of conditions or variables under which a tester will determine whether a system under test satisfies requirements or works correctly.
- **Test Suite**: A collection of test cases that are intended to be executed together.
- **Test Plan**: A document describing the scope, approach, resources, and schedule of intended testing activities.
- **Test Strategy**: A high-level document that outlines the testing approach, objectives, and methods.
- **Test Environment**: The hardware and software environment in which tests are executed.

## Testing Methodologies <a name="methodologies"></a>

### 1. Waterfall Testing
- Sequential approach where testing occurs after development
- Rigid and structured
- Suitable for projects with well-defined requirements
- Limited flexibility for changes

### 2. Agile Testing
- Iterative and incremental approach
- Testing occurs throughout the development cycle
- Emphasizes collaboration and adaptability
- Key practices:
  - Continuous Integration/Continuous Testing
  - Test-Driven Development (TDD)
  - Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
  - Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD)

### 3. V-Model Testing
- Extension of the waterfall model
- Each development phase has a corresponding testing phase
- Emphasizes verification and validation
- Good for projects requiring strict compliance

### 4. DevOps Testing
- Integration of testing into the DevOps pipeline
- Automated testing at multiple stages
- Continuous testing and feedback
- Focus on speed and reliability

## Testing Frameworks <a name="frameworks"></a>
