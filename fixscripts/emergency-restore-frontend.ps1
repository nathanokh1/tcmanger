PROBLEM: Previous changes broke frontend serving
- Users saw fallback HTML instead of login/dashboard

SOLUTION:
‚úÖ Re-enabled Next.js static export for Railway
‚úÖ Fixed static file serving configuration  
‚úÖ Restored proper routing for login/dashboard/admin portals
‚úÖ API routes still protected and functional

RESULT: Login page and all dashboards should be restored"
