# TCManager Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for the TCManager platform, providing a structured approach to developing the features identified in the Feature Catalog. The plan is organized by development phases, with specific tasks, timelines, and resource allocations for each phase.

## Implementation Approach

The TCManager platform will be implemented using an iterative, agile approach with the following principles:

1. **Feature-First Development**: Focus on delivering complete, usable features rather than technical components
2. **Continuous Integration**: Integrate code frequently to maintain a stable codebase
3. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementing features to ensure quality
4. **User-Centered Design**: Involve users in the design process to ensure usability
5. **Modular Architecture**: Build a modular system that can be extended and customized
