## Current Focus
We are currently in Phase 1, focusing on setting up the core infrastructure. The immediate next steps are:

1. Database Setup
   - Implement MongoDB connection
   - Create initial schemas
   - Set up data validation

2. Authentication System
   - Implement user authentication
   - Set up JWT handling
   - Configure role-based access

3. Core API Development
   - Create basic CRUD endpoints
   - Implement validation
   - Add error handling

## Getting Started
To contribute to the current phase:
1. Check the [setup guide](../guides/setup.md) for development environment setup
2. Review the [workflow guide](../guides/workflow.md) for development practices
3. See the [architecture documentation](../technical/architecture.md) for system design
4. Follow the [security guidelines](../technical/security.md) for implementation
