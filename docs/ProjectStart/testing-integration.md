# Testing Integration with TCManager

## Overview
This document outlines the integration approach between TheWallet application's testing framework and TCManager (Test Case Management System). The goal is to maintain a synchronized testing environment where test cases, results, and logs are managed both locally and in TCManager.

## Integration Strategy

### Local Testing Structure
- Test cases and results remain in the application's directory
- Follows standard Playwright testing structure
- Maintains direct connection to application code
- Enables quick local development and testing

### TCManager Integration
- Acts as a centralized test management system
- Syncs with local test cases and results
- Provides additional features:
  * Test case organization
  * Result tracking
  * Reporting
  * Team collaboration

### Synchronization Flow
1. **Local to TCManager**:
   - Test cases are pushed to TCManager
   - Test results are automatically synced
   - Screenshots and videos are uploaded
   - Execution logs are transferred

2. **TCManager to Local**:
   - Test case updates are pulled
   - New test cases are downloaded
   - Test templates are synchronized
   - Configuration updates are applied

## Configuration
```json
// .tcm/config.json
{
  "tcmUrl": "http://localhost:3000",
  "projectId": "thewallet",
  "syncInterval": 300,
  "autoSync": true,
  "features": {
    "screenshots": true,
    "videos": true,
    "logs": true
  }
}
```
